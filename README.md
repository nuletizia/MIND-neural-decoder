This repository contains the official TensorFlow implementation of the following paper:

MIND: Maximum Mutual Information Based Neural Decoder : TO ADD

If you use the repository for your experiments, please cite the paper.

The paper presents a neural decoding strategy that is based on the mutual information maximization, denoted as MIND.
MIND is a simple feedforward neural network trained to estimate density-ratios and the mutual information. 

Several options are available to train your own MIND model.
